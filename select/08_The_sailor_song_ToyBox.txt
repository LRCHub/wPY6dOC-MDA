So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just to sing, "We love you"
And if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you

Racing all around the seven seas
Chasing all the girls and making robberies
Causing panic everywhere they go
Party-hearty on Titanic

Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing
Drinking, drinking till the ship is sinking
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex appealing
Come, let us sing the sailor song

So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just to sing, "We love you"
And if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you

Sailor man, you really turn me on (arr)
Now the guys are gone, come let us get it on
Girls like me are pretty hard to find
So if you go, I'll kick your hiney

Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing
Drinking, drinking till the ship is sinking
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex appealing
Come, let us sing the sailor song

So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just to sing, "We love you"
And if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you

Now, let's fight
Ha, that's not a knife, this is a knife
Ay, ow, ooh

Sailing, sailing, jumping off the railing
Drinking, drinking till the ship is sinking
Gambling, stealing, lots of sex appealing
Come, let us sing the sailor song

So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just to sing, "We love you"
And if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you

Oh yeah
Ow
I'm king of the world, woo-hoo
Wow, this was great
Yeah, baby, you can sail my ship
So if we all come together, we know what to do
We all come together just for you (yeah)
