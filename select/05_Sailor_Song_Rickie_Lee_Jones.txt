Oh the ship i'm on
Time is what i ride
Forty winds, the captain and the tide
Oh a sailor boy
Stole me from my home
And this sea of joy
Is the only life i've known

I could fly away
I could fly away
But i take the sea
For stranger days than these

A salty dog
Is caught up on the reef
And the bottom of the sea
She kisses in relief

She could fly away
She could fly away
But she takes the sea
For stranger days than these

You trade your life
When something comes for you
And you bury the knife
Between the lies and truth

You could fly away
You could fly away
But you take the sea
For stranger days than these
And I take the sea
For stranger days than these
Stranger days...
